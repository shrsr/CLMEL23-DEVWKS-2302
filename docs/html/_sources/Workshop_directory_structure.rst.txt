==================
Workshop Directory
==================

Before you start with the modules, it is important to familiarize yourself with the structure of the working directory. Here is the directory structure for this workshop:

.. code-block:: bash

   workshop/
   ├── DEVWKS-2302/
   │   ├── Module1/
   │   │   └── my_ACI_playbook.yml
   │   ├── Module2/
   │   │   ├── ansible_to_TF.yml   
   │   │   ├── filter_plugins/   
   │   │   ├── go.mod   
   │   │   ├── go.sum   
   │   │   ├── inventory.networking 
   │   │   └── my_ACI_playbook.yml
   │   ├── Module3_optional/
   │   │   └── my_ACI_role/
   │   └── translator/


Each directory corresponds to a different part of the workshop:

* **Module1**: You will utilize the file `my_ACI_playbook.yml`, which will be selected from a drop-down menu within the web application.

* **Module2**: In this module, you'll primarily be working with and modifying the `my_ACI_playbook.yml` and `inventory.networking` files.

* **Module3_optional**: For the optional third module, you'll be selecting the zipped version of the role `my_ACI_role` from a drop-down menu within the application.

* **translator**: This directory contains the necessary files to start the translator application used in the workshop.
