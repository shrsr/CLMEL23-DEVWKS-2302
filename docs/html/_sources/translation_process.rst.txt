.. _translation_process:

Important Note
==============

- This translation process is specifically designed for **Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)**.
- It's important to note that this is **not a static translation**.
- The process does not directly convert an Ansible playbook (written in YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language) into a Terraform configuration file (written in HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language).
- For the translation to complete, the selected playbook will be run by Ansible and will interact with the provided Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC).
- Please remember, an APIC simulator is the minimum requirement for this process.
