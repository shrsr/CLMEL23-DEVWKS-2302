Overview
--------
This guide is designed to walk you through the entire workshop in easy steps. The workshop is divided into three modules. Please note, the third module is optional and can be completed if time permits.

Modules
-------
* **Module 1:** Translate **my_ACI_playbook.yml** using the translator application. In this module, you will be guided through the process of translating a playbook using the translator web application.

* **Module 2:** Manually translate **my_ACI_playbook.yml**. This module involves manually translating the same playbook, replicating the steps from Module 1. This allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the application's backend processes.

* **Module 3 (Optional):** Translate **my_ACI_role** using the translator application. This optional module guides you through the process of translating an entire Ansible ACI role using the translator web application.
